# aiaa-ucf-ramjet
software repository for the 2020-2021 senior design capstone project for the AIAA UCF ramjet

This Project is mainly divided into two areas, combustion analysis and intake analysis. The file structure will reflect these areas. documentation on how to operate will be included in the subfolders

## Getting Started
clone the repository to a directory of your choosing
`git clone https://github.com/BasicWalker/aiaa-ucf-ramjet.git`

## [Combustion](combustion)
the combustion area of focus aims to design and analyze combustion phenomena regarding the ramjet combustion chamber and nozzle 

## [Intake](intake)
the intake area of focus aims to design and analyze the geometry of the intake in order to supply the combustion chamber with subsonic flow at pressures for efficient combustion
